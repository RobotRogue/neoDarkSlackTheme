# neoDarkSlackTheme
A dark slack theme for the desktop client

## Installation Instructions:
You can find the install instructions from [this site](https://www.howtogeek.com/368976/how-to-install-the-unofficial-dark-mode-for-slack/)

This theme is borrowed heavily from [this fork](https://github.com/caiceA/slack-black-theme) ... I will properly fork from the origin once I get all the styles configured the way I want them to look. 

Also added a bunch of style fixes that were missed by the forked version such as alignment and buttons/text that was still too difficult to read.
