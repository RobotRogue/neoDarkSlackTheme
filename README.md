# neoDarkSlackTheme

## NOTICE: This no longer works, since the rad folks at Slack added Dark Mode! <3

## About:
Prefer not to have your retinas burned to a crsip when you open slack for work? 
Well, with some simple modifications you can have a dark slack theme for the desktop client!

AFAIK it is also persistent between client updates so that's a massive plus.

## Installation Instructions:
You can find the install instructions from [this site](https://www.howtogeek.com/368976/how-to-install-the-unofficial-dark-mode-for-slack/)

## Notes:
I added a bunch of style fixes that were missed by the forked version such as alignment and buttons/text that was still too difficult to read, aside from that I customized a lot of the colors for a more 'easier to read on a dark background' vibe.

This theme is borrowed heavily from [this fork](https://github.com/caiceA/slack-black-theme) ... I will properly fork from the origin once I get all the styles configured the way I want them to look.

An empty theme for your own customizations can be found [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/widget-/slack-black-theme/master/custom.css)

## Todos:
There are still a few alignment issues here and there that I am hunting down and will fix in a future update.
